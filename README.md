If you're using an addon to collect up all of your minimap buttons, for addons will refuse to cooperate.  
TurtleSnacks will throw them in the sack with the others.

Tested and working well with [Minimap Button Frame](https://github.com/laytya/MinimapButtonFrame-vanilla) and [pfUI](https://shagu.org/) 

MinimapButtonBag didn't want to feed the Turtles, so I've shown it the error of it's ways!!
