If you're using an addon collects up all of your minimap buttons, Turtle WoW's addons will refuse to cooperate.

TurtleSnacks will throw them in the sack with the others.

Tested and working well with [Minimap Button Frame](https://github.com/laytya/MinimapButtonFrame-vanilla) and [pfUI](https://shagu.org/)
